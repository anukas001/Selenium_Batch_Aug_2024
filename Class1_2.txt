What is Java
Popular programming Language

Where Java is used
> Mobile application
> Deskptop based application
> games
> Database connection


Why Java?
Java works with all the platforms (Window , Mac , Linux)
Huge demand in job market
Easy to learn and open source
Secure and fast and powerful
Programming language should have huge community support




Pre Requisite
- Installation of java before starting with programming


Eclipse
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/2024-06/R/eclipse-inst-jre-win64.exe


Setting path in environment variable


Class name : HelloWorld

main()----> Any code inside main() method will be executed


Public: Access Specifier , can be accessed publically . It means everyone can access this method

static: It is an access modifier ,whenever we have this java program loaded so memory is created automatically

Void: It does not return any value



variable: 


Different types of variable
String: stores text , "Hello World"
int: stores integer  (123 or -123)
float: stores floating point number (19.999)
char: single character ,such as 'a' and 'B'
boolean: store true or false


Final ---> if we don't want to overwrite existing values

use the final keyword


String Immutability

Immutable objects-->objects whose elements cannot be modified once declared

How String are immutable ?

Java Method

> Method is block of code which runs when it is called

> We can pass data in method which is called s parameter

Methods are used to perform certain actions that's why known as functions aswell


static void myMethod(String fname) {
		//code
	}



OOPS Concepts:

OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming

> faster and easier to executed
> clear structure for program


Java - What are Classes and Objects

class -----> fruit
Objects ---> banana , apple , mango

Four Main Object Oriented Programming concepts

Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

Abstraction : It is a process of hiding implementation details and exposing functionality to user.

User only knows "what it does" rather than "how it i being done"

There are two ways to achieve the abatraction
> Abstract class (0 to 100%)
> Interface (100%)


Certain key points should be remebered regarding pillars OOPS

> The class needs to be abstract if a class has one or more abstract methods
> Abstract class can have constructor , finl methods ,static methods aswell
> Abstract class can't be directly instantiated with the new operator

A b = new B(); ----> interface


A b = new A();

> The child class should override all the above mentods of the parents -- it should be declared with abstract keyword.


Encapsulation: It is the process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit


In order to achieve encapsulation in java we need to follow certain steps

> Declare the variable as private



Classname obj = new Classname;
Obj.


-------------------------------------------

Inheritance

class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name
{
// methods
}


-------------------------
 Polymorphism
 
 1) Static Polymorphism----> complile time , method overloading
 2) Dynamic Polymorphism ----> method overriding
 
 
 public class Car {
 public void speed() {
 }
 public void speed(String accelerator) {
 
 }
 
 public void speed(String accelerator, String speedup
 
 ) {
 
 }
 
 
 
 }
 
 -------------------------------------------------
 
 Java Array: 
 
 
 Array is a collection of similar type of element
 
 dataType[] arr;
 dataType []arr;
 
 Instantiation of an Aray
 
 arrayRefernce =new datatype[size];
 
 
 For each:
 
 for (type var : array)
 
 {
 statements
 }
 
 if (condition) {
 // blaock of code
 }
