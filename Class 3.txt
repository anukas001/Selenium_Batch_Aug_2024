How does selenium works:

1) User Code: The user creates automation script. It can contain instructions and commands for interacting with web elements/pages
2) Selenium Client Library: It acts as a bridge between user code and webdriver. It provides APIs that allows user code to control web browser.
3) Webdriver API: It establishes a common language for browser automation
4) Browser driving force: 

chrome ------------>ChromeDriver
Internet explorer----> InternetExplorer driver
Firefox -------> GeckoDriver

5) Browser
